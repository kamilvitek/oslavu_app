# Venue-City Mapping Fix

## Problem Statement

The application was experiencing issues where events had their city incorrectly set as country names (e.g., "Czech Republic" instead of "Prague"). This caused the conflict analysis to miss relevant events and provide less accurate results to users.

**Example Scenario:**
- Event venue: "O2 Arena"
- Event city: "Czech Republic" (incorrect)
- Expected city: "Prague" (correct)

## Solution Overview

Implemented a comprehensive venue-to-city mapping system that automatically corrects city information based on venue names. This ensures that when an event's city is incorrectly set as a country name, the system can determine the correct city based on the venue location.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Venue-City Mapping Service

**File:** `src/lib/services/venue-city-mapping.ts`

- **Comprehensive venue database**: Maps 50+ major venues to their correct cities
- **Multi-language support**: Handles Czech diacritics (e.g., "Forum Karl√≠n", "ƒåEZ Arena")
- **International venues**: Includes major venues from London, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, etc.
- **Confidence levels**: High/medium/low confidence ratings for mapping accuracy
- **Pattern matching**: Supports partial venue name matching
- **Case insensitive**: Works with any case variation

### 2. Enhanced Ticketmaster Service

**File:** `src/lib/services/ticketmaster.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- **Priority-based city extraction**: Always tries venue-based city extraction first
- **Enhanced logging**: Better debugging information for city extraction
- **Fallback logic**: Multiple fallback methods for city determination

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only tried venue extraction if city was a country name
if (venueCity && this.isCountryName(venueCity)) {
  const cityFromVenue = this.extractCityFromVenueName(venueName);
  // ...
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Always try venue extraction first (most reliable)
const cityFromVenue = this.extractCityFromVenueName(venueName);
if (cityFromVenue) {
  extractedCity = cityFromVenue;
  console.log(`üéüÔ∏è Ticketmaster: Extracted city "${cityFromVenue}" from venue name for event "${tmEvent.name}"`);
}
// Then fallback to other methods if needed
```

### 3. Enhanced PredictHQ Service

**File:** `src/lib/services/predicthq.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- **Venue-first approach**: Prioritizes venue-based city extraction
- **Better integration**: Uses the comprehensive venue-city mapping service
- **Improved logging**: Clear indication when venue mapping is used

### 4. Enhanced Venue Intelligence Service

**File:** `src/lib/services/venue-intelligence.ts`

**Key Changes:**
- **Dynamic city detection**: Uses venue-city mapping for accurate city information
- **Realistic location data**: Provides correct coordinates and city information
- **Better pricing**: City-specific pricing based on actual venue location

## Venue Database Coverage

### Czech Republic Venues
- **Prague**: O2 Arena, Forum Karl√≠n, Rudolfinum, National Theatre, State Opera, Prague Castle, Charles University, etc.
- **Brno**: Brno Exhibition Centre, Masaryk University, etc.
- **Ostrava**: Ostrava Arena, ƒåEZ Arena, etc.
- **Other cities**: Olomouc, Plzen, Liberec, Ceske Budejovice, Hradec Kralove, Pardubice, Zlin, Karlovy Vary

### International Venues
- **London**: O2 Arena London, Excel London, Olympia London, Barbican Centre, etc.
- **Berlin**: Messe Berlin, Berlin Congress Centre, etc.
- **Paris**: Porte de Versailles, Paris Expo, Palais des Congr√®s, etc.
- **Amsterdam**: RAI Amsterdam, Amsterdam Convention Centre, etc.
- **Vienna**: Vienna Marriott, Hilton Vienna, etc.
- **Munich**: Munich Marriott, Hilton Munich, etc.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
**File:** `src/lib/services/__tests__/venue-city-mapping.test.ts`
- 31 comprehensive test cases
- Covers all major venues and edge cases
- Tests case insensitivity, special characters, and partial matches

### Integration Tests
**File:** `src/lib/services/__tests__/venue-city-integration.test.ts`
- 9 integration test cases
- Tests real-world scenarios with Ticketmaster and PredictHQ services
- Verifies the specific O2 Arena scenario mentioned in the issue

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Event Detection
- **Better accuracy**: Events are now correctly associated with their actual cities
- **More relevant results**: Users get events from the correct geographic location
- **Reduced false positives**: Foreign events are properly filtered out

### 2. Enhanced Conflict Analysis
- **Accurate venue intelligence**: Correct city-specific pricing and capacity data
- **Better risk assessment**: More accurate conflict scoring based on actual location
- **Improved recommendations**: Better date and venue recommendations

### 3. User Experience
- **More relevant events**: Users see events that are actually in their target city
- **Better venue information**: Accurate venue details and location data
- **Improved search results**: More precise event filtering and categorization

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: O2 Arena Event
**Before:**
- Venue: "O2 Arena"
- City: "Czech Republic"
- Result: Event might be filtered out or incorrectly categorized

**After:**
- Venue: "O2 Arena"
- City: "Prague" (corrected via venue mapping)
- Result: Event correctly identified as Prague event, included in Prague searches

### Scenario 2: International Venue
**Before:**
- Venue: "O2 Arena London"
- City: "United Kingdom"
- Result: Event might be included in Czech searches

**After:**
- Venue: "O2 Arena London"
- City: "London" (corrected via venue mapping)
- Result: Event correctly identified as London event, excluded from Czech searches

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Venue mapping is done in-memory with O(1) lookup
- **Cached results**: No external API calls required
- **Fast execution**: Pattern matching is optimized for performance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic venue database**: Could be extended to load from external sources
2. **Machine learning**: Could use ML to automatically detect venue-city relationships
3. **User feedback**: Could allow users to report incorrect venue mappings
4. **Geographic expansion**: Could add more international venues as needed

## Conclusion

This fix significantly improves the accuracy of event location detection, leading to better conflict analysis results and a more reliable user experience. The comprehensive venue database ensures that major venues are correctly mapped to their cities, while the fallback logic handles edge cases gracefully.
